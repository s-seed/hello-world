# hello-world
Hello! My name is Sam Seed. I'm a recent Warwick Mathematics graduate living in Leamington Spa. I spend my time having fun, cooking with my friends, riding my bike and working out what to do next. I am interested in developing my programming skills, because I enjoy programming and because it will be an invaluable skill throughout my life.

There's more to me than that but let's leave it there for now.
